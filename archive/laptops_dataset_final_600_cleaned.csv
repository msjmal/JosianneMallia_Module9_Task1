you can't upgrade your ram, because it is soldered on the motherboard.

acer nitro v intel core i5 13th gen 13420h - (16 gb/512 gb ssd...,4.3,256,21,5,super!,"best performance in this price range. 13th gen i5 with 4050 is good enough for 1080p ultra graphics gaming. fans are a bit loud as they rotate at 8000rpm! but it keeps the temps low. 512gb ssd is a low storage if gaming is considered as games nowadays are min 40gb in size.

packaging was good.

overall, go for it if your budget is around 75k.

acer nitro v amd ryzen 7 octa core 7735hs - (16 gb/512 gb ssd/...,4.3,153,27,2,nice,build quality of acer nitro from 4 or 5 years ago was much better than this. the keyboard seems relatively flimsy for a gaming laptop. the worst design flaw of this laptop is that the display opens up in such a way that that the hot air from the fan vents hit one side of the bottom of the display which starts heating up. this most definitely reduces the life of the display. it doesn't feel as if this laptop nitro model is durable enough to last more than a couple of years.

the laptop is really exceptional at this price range with i7 processor.

best for business work.

body is made up of polycarbonate plastic with nice friction body which helps in holding.

display is nice .

almost 5 hr battery backup.

i have only one issue that is the charger which comes with it is not made by acer company due to this it's adaptor gets heat quickly.

overall nice experience.

go for it."
